INTRODUCTION
---------------------
My website Find Furry Friends is a website where users can search for dogs for adoption near their location and for breeds they prefer. Users can add to favorite a particular dog based on their search results. Find Furry Friends is built with Python Flask on the backend with a PostgreSQL database, and Javascript/jQuery on the frontend along with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.

Please see this video for a full walkthrough.
